Description: In this package you can find functions to calculate with two complex numbers. You can add , subtract, multiplicate and divide.
   The numbers should be in the form z = a + b*i and w = c + d*i with real numbers a, b, c and d and i as the complex unit (iÂ² = -1).
   If the numbers are defined as above you can use the functions as following:
    - z + w = add(a,b,c,d)
    - z - w = dif(a,b,c,d)
    - z * w = mult(a,b,c,d)
    - z / w = div(a,b,c,d)
